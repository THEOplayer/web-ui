# @theoplayer/web-ui

## 1.16.3

### 🐛 Issues

- Improve labels for text tracks and audio tracks in the `<theoplayer-language-menu>`.

## 1.16.2

### 🐛 Issues

- Language names in the language menu are now capitalized according to that language's case mappings.

## 1.16.1

### 🐛 Issues

- Fixed a regression where menus would always fill the entire player on desktop (rather than opening as a small popup in the bottom right corner).

## 1.16.0

### ✨ Features

- Added `centered-chrome` slot to `<theoplayer-default-ui>` to replace all controls in the center of the player.

### 🐛 Issues

- Fixed an issue where buttons inside the default UI could accidentally be clicked even when they were hidden because of user inactivity.

## 1.15.0

### ✨ Features

- The UI now takes `SourceDescription.streamType` into account when computing its own `stream-type` attribute. This is now the preferred method of overriding the stream type.

### 🐛 Issues

- Fixed `<theolive-default-ui>` to stop using deprecated OptiView Live events.
- Fixed an issue where the `<theoplayer-time-range>` inside the default UI could accidentally be clicked even when it was hidden because of user inactivity.

## 1.14.0

### ✨ Features

- `<theoplayer-default-ui>` now hides all controls except the center play button when the player size is very small on desktop.
- Add `--theoplayer-centered-chrome-button-icon-width` CSS property to change the icon width of _only_ the buttons in the center slot in a `<theoplayer-default-ui>`.
- Add `--theoplayer-aspect-ratio` CSS property to change the aspect ratio of a `<theoplayer-default-ui>` or `<theoplayer-ui>`.
- Add `--theoplayer-min-width` CSS property to override the `min-width` of a `<theoplayer-default-ui>` or `<theoplayer-ui>`.
- Add `--theoplayer-height` CSS property to override the height of the inner `<theoplayer-ui>` within a `<theoplayer-default-ui>`.

### 🐛 Issues

- Fixed an issue where the menus didn't cover the entire player when the player is too small.

## 1.13.1

### 🐛 Issues

- When entering fullscreen, the player will now always hide the browser's navigation UI. (This can be overridden by setting [`ui.fullscreenOptions.navigationUI`](https://optiview.dolby.com/docs/theoplayer/v10/api-reference/web/interfaces/FullscreenOptions.html#navigationUI) in your player configuration.)

## 1.13.0 (2025-09-12)

- 💅 Optimized performance of `<theoplayer-time-range>`. ([#70](https://github.com/THEOplayer/web-ui/issues/70))

      to avoid synchronous re-layouts as much as possible.
    - When playing a long video, the seek bar no longer uses `requestAnimationFrame` at all to update its progress.
      Instead, it updates using only less frequent `timeupdate` events.

## 1.8.1 (2024-04-18)

- 🐛 Fixed `ui.player.destroy()` not working. ([#59](https://github.com/THEOplayer/web-ui/issues/59), [#62](https://github.com/THEOplayer/web-ui/pull/62))

## 1.8.0 (2024-04-12)

- 💥 **Breaking Change**: This project now requires THEOplayer version 7.0.0 or higher. ([#60](https://github.com/THEOplayer/web-ui/pull/60))
- 🚀 Added `<theolive-default-ui>` that provides a default UI for THEOlive streams. ([#58](https://github.com/THEOplayer/web-ui/pull/58))

- 💅 Allow importing `@theoplayer/web-ui/package.json`. ([#53](https://github.com/THEOplayer/web-ui/pull/53))

## 1.7.0 (2024-02-15)

- 🚀 Added support for loading in Node for static site generation (SSG) or server-side rendering (SSR). ([#50](https://github.com/THEOplayer/web-ui/pull/50))
    - ⚠️ Although the Node entry point exports all custom element classes as usual, attempting to actually construct those classes will result in errors. Most dependencies are either replaced with stubs (using [`@lit-labs/ssr-dom-shim`](https://lit.dev/docs/ssr/dom-emulation/)) or removed altogether (such as THEOplayer itself).
    - This should always be used together with an SSG or SSR solution. For example, you can use [Open Video UI for React](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@theoplayer/react-ui) together with [React server rendering](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/server).
- 🐛 Fixed an issue where `<theoplayer-ui>` could throw an error when the player changes sources before all custom elements are properly registered. ([#49](https://github.com/THEOplayer/web-ui/pull/49))

## 1.6.0 (2024-02-08)

- 🚀 Introducing [Open Video UI for React](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@theoplayer/react-ui). ([#48](https://github.com/THEOplayer/web-ui/pull/48))
    - Idiomatic React components make the Open Video UI feel right at home in your existing React web app.
- 🚀 Added support for advertisements while casting to Chromecast. This requires THEOplayer version 6.8.0 or higher. ([#47](https://github.com/THEOplayer/web-ui/pull/47))
- 🚀 Added `theoplayerready` event to `<theoplayer-default-ui>` and `<theoplayer-ui>`, which is fired once the backing THEOplayer instance is created. ([#48](https://github.com/THEOplayer/web-ui/pull/48)).

## 1.5.0 (2023-11-27)

- 🚀 Added support for smart TVs. ([#40](https://github.com/THEOplayer/web-ui/pull/40))
    - Updated `<theoplayer-default-ui>` to automatically switch to an optimized layout when running on a smart TV.
      For custom UIs using `<theoplayer-ui>`, you can use the `tv-only` and `tv-hidden` attributes to show or hide specific UI elements on smart TVs.
    - Added support for navigating the UI using a TV remote control.
    - Added a `tv-focus` attribute to specify which UI element should receive the initial focus when showing the controls on a TV.
      In the default UI, initial focus is on the seek bar.
- 🚀 Allow overriding more CSS properties of `<theoplayer-default-ui>`. ([#42](https://github.com/THEOplayer/web-ui/pull/42))
- 💅 Renamed project to "THEOplayer Open Video UI for Web". ([#43](https://github.com/THEOplayer/web-ui/pull/43))

## 1.4.0 (2023-10-04)

- 💥 **Breaking Change**: This project now requires THEOplayer version 6.0.0 or higher.
- 🚀 Open Video UI now imports THEOplayer as a JavaScript module using `import from 'theoplayer/chromeless'`.
  See the [README](https://github.com/THEOplayer/web-ui/blob/v1.4.0/README.md#installation) for updated installation instructions.
- 🐛 When the player's source is empty, the UI will no longer attempt to play when clicked. ([#37](https://github.com/THEOplayer/web-ui/pull/37))

## 1.3.0 (2023-05-16)

- 💥 **Breaking Change**: This project now requires THEOplayer version 5.1.0 or higher.
- 🏠 This project now depends on the chromeless version of THEOplayer, rather than the full version which includes the old video.js-based UI. ([#31](https://github.com/THEOplayer/web-ui/pull/31))
- 🐛 Fix `has-error` attribute not cleared on source change ([#29](https://github.com/THEOplayer/web-ui/pull/29))

## 1.2.0 (2023-04-26)

- 🚀 Improved support for advertisements ([#28](https://github.com/THEOplayer/web-ui/pull/28))
    - Reworked the ad control bar in `<theoplayer-default-ui>`.
    - Added a `show-ad-markers` attribute to `<theoplayer-time-range>`, to show markers on the progress bar indicating when the content will be interrupted by an advertisement.
    - `<theoplayer-ad-skip-button>` and `<theoplayer-ad-clickthrough-button>` are automatically hidden while playing a Google IMA ad. (This is unfortunately necessary, because Google IMA doesn't provide a way to modify or replace its own buttons.)
- 🐛 When the player changes sources, any open menu is now automatically closed

## 1.1.0 (2023-04-12)

- 💥 **Breaking Change**: This project now targets modern browsers, so `dist/THEOplayerUI.js` and `dist/THEOplayerUI.mjs` now use ES2017 syntax (such as `class` and `async`/`await`). See "Legacy browser support" in the [README](https://github.com/THEOplayer/web-ui/blob/v1.1.0/README.md) for more information about targeting older browsers. ([#26](https://github.com/THEOplayer/web-ui/issues/26), [#27](https://github.com/THEOplayer/web-ui/pull/27))
- 🚀 Added support for THEOplayer 5.0
- 💅 Improved accessibility ([#21](https://github.com/THEOplayer/web-ui/pull/21))
- 💅 Make menus fill entire player when player is small ([#22](https://github.com/THEOplayer/web-ui/pull/22))
- 🐛 Ensure `player` property is initialized immediately when calling `new UIContainer(configuration)` with a valid player configuration ([#24](https://github.com/THEOplayer/web-ui/pull/24))

## 1.0.0 (2023-04-05)

- 🚀 Initial release
