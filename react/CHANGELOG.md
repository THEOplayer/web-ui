## v1.7.0 (2024-02-15)

-   🚀 Added support for loading in Node for static site generation (SSG) or server-side rendering (SSR). ([#50](https://github.com/THEOplayer/web-ui/pull/50))
    -   This allows you to pass React components (such as `<DefaultUI>`, `<UIContainer>` or `<PlayButton>`) to the [Server React DOM APIs](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/server), or to use them with a framework that supports SSG or SSR (such as Next.js, Remix or Gatsby).
    -   ⚠️ The rendered HTML must still be [hydrated](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/client/hydrateRoot#hydrating-server-rendered-html) on the client to load the Open Video UI properly. (Usually, this handled automatically by your React framework.)
-   🚀 Added utility hooks such as `useCurrentTime()`, `usePaused()` and `useVolume()`. ([#51](https://github.com/THEOplayer/web-ui/pull/51))
    -   See [the API documentation](https://theoplayer.github.io/web-ui/react-api/) for more information.
