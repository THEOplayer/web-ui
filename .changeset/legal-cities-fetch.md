'@theoplayer/web-ui': patch
---

When entering fullscreen, the player will now always hide the browser's navigation UI. (This can be overridden by setting [`ui.fullscreenOptions.navigationUI`](https://optiview.dolby.com/docs/theoplayer/v10/api-reference/web/interfaces/FullscreenOptions.html#navigationUI) in your player configuration.)
