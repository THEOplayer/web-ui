Open Video UI for Web is now built using [Lit](https://lit.dev/).

- This shouldn't affect any custom UIs or custom components built using Open Video UI for React.
- For older browsers that don't support Custom Elements, we recommend loading our new polyfills library from `@theoplayer/web-ui/polyfills`.
