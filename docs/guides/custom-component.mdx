# Making a custom component

import Example from '../components/Example';
import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';
import Link from '@docusaurus/Link';
import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';
import styles from './shared.module.css';
import playButtonStep1 from '!!raw-loader!../static/open-video-ui/v1/guides/web/custom-component/my-play-button-step1.js';
import playButtonStep2 from '!!raw-loader!../static/open-video-ui/v1/guides/web/custom-component/my-play-button-step2.js';
import qualityLabelStep1 from '!!raw-loader!../static/open-video-ui/v1/guides/web/custom-component/my-quality-label-step1.js';
import qualityLabelStep2 from '!!raw-loader!../static/open-video-ui/v1/guides/web/custom-component/my-quality-label-step2.js';

## A custom play button

First, we'll build a simple button that plays or pauses the player when clicked.

:::tip

The built-in [`<theoplayer-play-button>`](https://theoplayer.github.io/web-ui/api/classes/PlayButton.html) also provides this functionality.

:::

### Step 1: Create a custom button

Create a new JavaScript file called `my-play-button.js` with the following code:

<!-- See https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/react#importing-code-snippets -->

<CodeBlock
    language="js"
    showLineNumbers
    title={
        <Link href="https://github.com/THEOplayer/web-ui/blob/main/docs/static/open-video-ui/v1/guides/web/custom-component/my-play-button-step1.js">
            my-play-button.js (step 1)
        </Link>
    }
>
    {playButtonStep1}
</CodeBlock>

Now add your new button to your custom UI. In our example, we'll place it in the `centered-chrome` slot, so it'll appear in the center of the player:

```html
<script type="module" src="./my-play-button.js"></script>
<theoplayer-ui
    configuration='{"libraryLocation":"/path/to/node_modules/theoplayer/","license":"your_theoplayer_license_goes_here"}'
    source='{"sources":{"src":"https://example.com/stream.m3u8"}}'
>
    <!-- highlight-start -->
    <my-play-button slot="centered-chrome"></my-play-button>
    <!-- highlight-end -->
</theoplayer-ui>
```

It should look something like this:

<Example
    className={styles.player}
    src={useBaseUrl('/open-video-ui/v1/guides/web/custom-component/my-play-button-step1.html')}
    hideDeviceType
    hideSource
    hideLocale
/>

Try clicking the "Play" button in the middle of the screen.
You should see an alert window popping up saying `My play button was clicked!`.

### Step 2: Integrate with the backing player

Of course, we want the player to start playing instead of showing an alert!
For this, we need to get access to the backing THEOplayer instance.

Open Video UI for Web provides a built-in mechanism to automatically inject dependencies into UI components,
such as the player instance, or other fullscreen state of the UI. When a UI component is added as a child (or descendant)
of a `<theoplayer-default-ui>` or `<theoplayer-ui>`, the parent UI will automatically inject those dependencies.

First, the UI component needs to opt into this mechanism by [mixing in](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/mixins.html)
`StateReceiverMixin` into its superclass (see [API documentation](https://theoplayer.github.io/web-ui/api/functions/StateReceiverMixin.html)).
This mixin takes the original superclass, and an array of dependencies which need to be injected:

```js
import { Button, buttonTemplate, StateReceiverMixin } from '@theoplayer/web-ui';

export class MyPlayButton extends StateReceiverMixin(Button, ['player']) {
    // ...
}
```

Once this button is added to a `<theoplayer-ui>`, it'll automatically receive the backing THEOplayer instance in its `player` property.
If you want to do some custom logic when this happens, you can implement a setter for this property:

```js
export class MyPlayButton extends StateReceiverMixin(Button, ['player']) {
    set player(player) {
        this._player = player;
        console.log('My play button received a player!');
    }
}
```

Change your `handleClick()` method to call `play()` or `pause()` on the player.
You can also update the text content of your button to reflect the new state:

<CodeBlock
    language="js"
    showLineNumbers
    title={
        <Link href="https://github.com/THEOplayer/web-ui/blob/main/docs/static/open-video-ui/v1/guides/web/custom-component/my-play-button-step2.js">
            my-play-button.js (step 2)
        </Link>
    }
>
    {playButtonStep2}
</CodeBlock>

It should look something like this:

<Example
    className={styles.player}
    src={useBaseUrl('/open-video-ui/v1/guides/web/custom-component/my-play-button-step2.html')}
    hideDeviceType
    hideSource
    hideLocale
/>

Try clicking the "Play" button in the middle of the screen. The player starts playing!<br/>
Clicking it again should pause the player.

Congratulations, you've built your very own play button! üéâ

## A custom quality label

Next, let's create a label that displays the resolution of the player's current video quality.

:::tip

The built-in [`<theoplayer-active-quality-display>`](https://theoplayer.github.io/web-ui/api/classes/ActiveQualityDisplay.html) also provides this functionality.

:::

### Step 1: Create a custom component

Create a new JavaScript file called `my-quality-label.js` with the following code:

<CodeBlock
    language="js"
    showLineNumbers
    title={
        <Link href="https://github.com/THEOplayer/web-ui/blob/main/docs/static/open-video-ui/v1/guides/web/custom-component/my-quality-label-step1.js">
            my-quality-label.js (step 1)
        </Link>
    }
>
    {qualityLabelStep1}
</CodeBlock>

Now add your new label to your custom UI. In our example, we'll place it inside a `<theoplayer-control-bar>` in the default slot, so it'll appear at the bottom of the player:

```html
<script type="module" src="./my-quality-label.js"></script>
<theoplayer-ui
    configuration='{"libraryLocation":"/path/to/node_modules/theoplayer/","license":"your_theoplayer_license_goes_here"}'
    source='{"sources":{"src":"https://example.com/stream.m3u8"}}'
>
    <theoplayer-control-bar>
        <!-- A seek bar -->
        <theoplayer-time-range></theoplayer-time-range>
    </theoplayer-control-bar>
    <theoplayer-control-bar>
        <!-- A few commonly used built-in controls -->
        <theoplayer-play-button></theoplayer-play-button>
        <theoplayer-mute-button></theoplayer-mute-button>
        <!-- A spacer, to fill up the remaining space in the middle -->
        <span style="flex-grow: 1"></span>
        <!-- highlight-start -->
        <!-- Your brand new quality label! -->
        <my-quality-label></my-quality-label>
        <!-- highlight-end -->
        <!-- Some other controls -->
        <theoplayer-settings-menu-button menu="settings-menu"></theoplayer-settings-menu-button>
        <theoplayer-fullscreen-button></theoplayer-fullscreen-button>
    </theoplayer-control-bar>
    <!-- A settings menu, so you can manually change the active quality -->
    <theoplayer-settings-menu slot="menu" id="settings-menu"></theoplayer-settings-menu>
</theoplayer-ui>
```

It should look something like this:

<Example
    className={styles.player}
    src={useBaseUrl('/open-video-ui/v1/guides/web/custom-component/my-quality-label-step1.html')}
    hideDeviceType
    hideSource
    hideLocale
/>

### Step 2: Listen to quality changes

Right now, the quality label is static, it doesn't actually update when the player's quality changes. Let's fix that!

1. Once again, we use the `StateReceiverMixin` to gain access to the backing THEOplayer instance.
2. When we receive the player, we add an event listener for the `addtrack` event of `player.videoTracks`,
   so we'll be notified when the video track becomes available.
3. We register an `activequalitychanged` event listener on that video track,
   so we can respond when the active video quality changes.
4. When our `activequalitychanged` listener fires, we update the contents of our `<span>` with the quality's height.

<CodeBlock
    language="js"
    showLineNumbers
    title={
        <Link href="https://github.com/THEOplayer/web-ui/blob/main/docs/static/open-video-ui/v1/guides/web/custom-component/my-quality-label-step2.js">
            my-quality-label.js (step 2)
        </Link>
    }
>
    {qualityLabelStep2}
</CodeBlock>

It should look something like this:

<Example
    className={styles.player}
    src={useBaseUrl('/open-video-ui/v1/guides/web/custom-component/my-quality-label-step2.html')}
    hideDeviceType
    hideSource
    hideLocale
/>

Try changing the active quality by clicking the ‚öôÔ∏è (Settings) button, and changing "Automatic" to a specific quality.
You should see your custom label update to show the height of the new quality.

That's it! You now have your very own active quality label! ü•≥
